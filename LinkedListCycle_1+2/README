linkedlistutils.cpp, linkedlistutils.h : define ListNode class, supply
insert and append member functions.

findcycle.cpp: see if there is a cycle.  Leetcode's LinkedListCycle 1

startOfCycle.cpp: Find the node which begins the cycle (see Geeks for
Geeks and Cracking the Coding Interview). Leetcode's LinkedListCycle 2.
Note: finding the cycle and leaving a pointer to a certain node in the
cycle must be done carefully and straightforwardly.

Bugs, or more correctly, missing tests: Does this work if the list

(a) is empty,
(b) has only one node (either not a loop or pointing to itself,
(c) has no "tail", so that the first node (pointed to by Head) is the first node
    of the cycle,
(d) has two nodes with
    (i) both nodes in the cycle (a special case of (c)), or
    (ii) the second node is the cycle (i.e., points to itself).
