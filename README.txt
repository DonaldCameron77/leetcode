README for Donald Cameron's leetcode repo

Certain people know about this repo.  If you simply found it by searching
for leetcode, may I suggest that you try to work on leetcode problems yourself,
and look at my (or anyone else's) solutions only after you get stuck, or to
compare after you have a complete solution.

If you want to discuss general aspects of this or other leetcode problems, the best
place to do that is on the leetcode online judge site.

On the other hand, if there are aspects of my solutions you want to discuss
or critique, you may email me through gitHub.  I cannot promise to respond,
but I will try to do so as time permits.
