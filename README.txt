README for Donald Cameron's leetcode repo

If you found this repo by Googling, may I suggest that you try to work on
leetcode problems yourself, and look at my (or anyone else's) solutions
after you get stuck, or to compare after you have a complete solution.

You may email me through gitHub.  I cannot promise to respond, but I will
try to do so as time permits.
